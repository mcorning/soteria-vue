      <v-card-subtitle>Start simple.</v-card-subtitle>
      <v-card-text
        >We just described local contact tracing. It can kill the virus all by
        itself.
      </v-card-text>
      <v-card-subtitle>Add capabilities as necessary.</v-card-subtitle>

      <v-card-text
        >If you live in a safe place, you may never receive and exposure alert.
        But if you do, use the other capabilities of the tool in your hands to
        further minimize pain and suffering and to hasten the day the virus is
        history.

      <v-card-text
        >First, track your symptoms. We give you a risk number based on public
        health data. If you get tested, install a digital ID wallet and enter
        your test results in a Covid-19 credential. If you manage a room,
        publish a risk threshold for your public space.
      </v-card-text>

      <v-card-text
        >Second, be more careful when you chose which public space to enter. If
        you manage a room, be more careful about who you admit into your space.
